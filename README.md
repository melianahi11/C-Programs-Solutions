This repository contains a collection of C programs, each serving different purposes. Below are the details for each program along with build and clean instructions.

## first

### Source File: `first.c`

#### Build Instructions:
```gcc -Wall -Werror -fsanitize=address first.c -o first```

##### Clean Instructions:
``` rm -rf first ```

###### Description:
The first program reads numbers from a file and determines if each number is a prime or a twin prime.

## second

### Source File: `second.c`

#### Build Instructions:
``` gcc -Wall -Werror -fsanitize=address second.c -o second ```

##### Clean Instructions:
```rm -rf second ```

###### Description:
The second program reads input data from a file and performs bitwise operations based on the input commands ("get", "comp", "set").

## third

### Source File: `third.c`

#### Build Instructions:
``` gcc -Wall -Werror -fsanitize=address third.c -o third ```

##### Clean Instructions:
``` rm -rf third ```

###### Description:
The third program calculates the parity and counts pairs of consecutive 1s in a binary representation of a given number.

## fourth
Source File: `fourth.c`

### Build Instructions:
``` gcc -Wall -Werror -fsanitize=address fourth.c -o fourth ```

#### Clean Instructions:
``` rm -rf fourth ```

##### Description:
The fourth program reads commands and values from a file to manipulate a sorted linked list. It supports insertion and deletion operations.


# PA2

Contains a collection of C programs, each designed to solve different problems. Below are the details for each program along with build and clean instructions.

## First

### Source File: `first.c`

#### Build Instructions:

```gcc -Wall -Werror -fsanitize=address first.c -o first```

##### Clean Instructions:
```rm -rf first```

###### Description:
The first program reads numbers from a file and determines if each number is a prime or a twin prime. It contains functions to perform input and output operations, as well as logic to identify prime and twin prime numbers.

## Second

### Source File: `second.c`

#### Build Instructions:
```gcc -Wall -Werror -fsanitize=address second.c -o second```

##### Clean Instructions:
```rm -rf second```

###### Description:
The second program reads input data from a file and performs bitwise operations based on the input commands ("get", "comp", "set"). It contains functions to process input commands and execute corresponding bitwise operations.

## Third

### Source File: `third.c`

#### Build Instructions:
```gcc -Wall -Werror -fsanitize=address third.c -o third```

##### Clean Instructions:
```rm -rf third```

###### Description:
The third program calculates the parity and counts pairs of consecutive 1s in a binary representation of a given number. It contains functions to compute parity and count pairs of consecutive 1s in a binary number.

## Fourth

### Source File: `fourth.c`

#### Build Instructions:
```gcc -Wall -Werror -fsanitize=address fourth.c -o fourth```

##### Clean Instructions:
```rm -rf fourth``` 

###### Description:
The fourth program reads commands and values from a file to manipulate a sorted linked list. It supports insertion and deletion operations on the linked list and contains functions to perform these operations.
